# Cascade

**A social-feed theme for Flarum 2.** Your discussion list stops being a list of
links and becomes a feed: the opening post's text and pictures on the card,
reactions, the latest reply, and the whole conversation in a modal over the top
of it — without ever leaving the page you were reading.

## What it actually does

Flarum shows you a title, an avatar, a tag and a reply count. A social feed shows
you the **post**. That one difference is what Cascade is built around.

- **The opening post on the card** — an excerpt, an image mosaic, the latest
  reply, all in the discussion list.
- **Reactions on the card**, with the hover picker you already know: the emoji
  row unfurls, each one grows under the pointer and names itself, the one you
  pick lands with a pop. Long-press on touch.
- **See more / See less** expands the post's text in place — it grows what is
  there, it does not swap the card for something else.
- **The conversation in a modal** over the feed. The discussion page still
  exists (it is the permalink every notification and search result points at)
  and the modal links to it, but you rarely need it.
- **Live typing indicator** inside that modal, when `flarum/realtime` is on.
- **Both rails stay put** while the feed scrolls, so navigation and the widgets
  are always reachable. A rail taller than the window scrolls inside itself.
- **Three presets** — an admin sets the forum's default, and members can pick
  their own from their settings page:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Facebook-style** (`wall`) | Cards on a grey ground, dense chrome, a wide labelled action bar. For forums whose visitors mostly lurk and need the affordance spelled out. |
| **X-style** (`timeline`) | No cards. One column between hairlines, a sticky tab strip, a quiet action bar. For busy forums where row count matters more. |
| **Bluesky-style** (`stream`) | One column again, but the row separators are inset to the text, the spacing is looser and the actions get pill hovers. Slate ground rather than navy. |

The names in brackets are the stored values and never change; the labels are
translatable strings.

## Install

```bash
composer require ernestdefoe/cascade
```

Then enable **Cascade** in your admin panel, and pick a preset under its
settings.

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Flarum | `2.0.0-rc.8` or newer |
| PHP | `8.3+` |
| Required | [`fof/reactions`](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/reactions) — Composer pulls it in |

`fof/reactions` currently has no stable 2.x release, so Composer resolves it at
beta. That needs no special flags: every Flarum 2 install already runs with a
relaxed `minimum-stability`, because Flarum 2 itself is a release candidate.

### Colour

Cascade deliberately adds **no accent-colour setting**. Your forum already has
one under **Appearance**, and Flarum computes button contrast colours from it at
compile time — a second accent would recolour half the page and leave the other
half pointing at the old one.

Everything around that accent is a **neutral graphite ramp**, shared by all
three presets. They used to carry their lineage's brand palette as well, which
made the resemblance louder than it needed to be and meant three colour systems
to keep legible across four theme modes instead of one. The ramp has no hue on
purpose: a grey with a cast reads as "almost blue" next to your accent and
fights it, while a true neutral leaves the accent as the only colour on the
page. Pick whatever accent suits your forum — the presets are told apart by
their structure, not their colour.

## Extensions it works with

Cascade implements none of these itself. It detects what you have and decorates
it; with any of them absent, the matching piece of UI is simply not rendered.

| Extension | What it adds |
|---|---|
| [`fof/reactions`](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/reactions) | The reaction control and the hover picker. **Required.** |
| [`flarum/tags`](https://github.com/flarum/tags) | Tag pills in the card's meta line — un-floated so you see all of them, not the first one and a half |
| [`flarum/realtime`](https://github.com/flarum/realtime) | The typing indicator in the conversation modal |
| [`fof/upload`](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/upload) | Attachments become the card's image mosaic |
| [`fof/forum-widgets-core`](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/forum-widgets-core) | Side widgets are adopted into Cascade's right rail rather than becoming a fourth column |
| [`ernestdefoe/mobile-tab`](https://github.com/ernestdefoe/mobile-tab) | Bottom tab bar on phones |

## Settings

Eight, in the extension's own admin page:

- **Preset** — the forum's default: Facebook-, X- or Bluesky-style
- **Let members choose their own** — adds a *Feed style* picker to each member's
  settings page. Their choice applies to them alone; anyone who leaves it on
  *Use the forum's default* follows the setting above. Turn it off to hold the
  whole forum to one look.
- **What each row shows** — excerpt and image / excerpt only / title only
- **Excerpt length** — 40 to 600 characters
- **Trending widget** — tags ranked by discussions actually started recently,
  recomputed hourly (never read from `tags.discussion_count`, which drifts)
- **Hashtag cloud widget** — a weighted cloud of the most-used hashtags, sized
  by rank rather than raw count so it stays readable however lopsided the
  numbers are. Appears only when
  [`ernestdefoe/hashtags`](https://packagist.org/packages/ernestdefoe/hashtags)
  is enabled; Cascade never depends on it.
- **Hashtags in the cloud** — 6 to 60
- **Engagement bar** — auto / always / hidden

## Performance

The thing that makes a feed expensive is putting a whole post in every list row,
and Flarum's core team removed `firstPost` from the discussion-list endpoint for
exactly that reason ([flarum/framework#4788](https://github.com/flarum/framework/pull/4788)).
Cascade does not put it back.

Instead it eager-loads the relation **without serialising it** and reads the
stored formatter XML directly — `parsed_content`, never `content` (which
unparses) or `formatContent()` (which renders) — shipping a capped plain-text
excerpt and a handful of image URLs. Reaction counts come from the request-scoped
memo `fof/reactions` already primes for every row's first post.

**Net cost: two eager loads per page of discussions. No migration, no new tables,
no extra requests.**

## Known gaps in 0.1

Being honest about what is not done yet:

- The **discussion page** is only lightly restyled. The modal is the intended
  path; the full page still looks close to stock.
- **Mobile** works but has had less attention than desktop.
- The modal's reply button opens Flarum's real composer rather than an inline
  comment box.
- The **X-style** and **Bluesky-style** presets have had less testing than
  Facebook-style.
- Only English ships, though every string is translatable — no hardcoded text.

## Reporting bugs

Please do. Open an [issue](https://github.com/ernestdefoe/cascade/issues), or
post on the [support forum](https://ernestdefoe.online/).

What helps most: your Flarum version, which other extensions are enabled, the
preset and colour scheme you were in, and a screenshot.
